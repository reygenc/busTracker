# Bus Tracker
## Description

This page tracks MBTA bus #1 live and updates the position every five seconds.

[This link will open the page.](https://reygenc.github.io/busTracker/)

In order to use this, click on the link above or below to load the page. When it finishes loading, click on the "Show Live Bus" button. The map will continuously update the position of MBTA bus #1 every five seconds.

In the future, I would like to add an option to be able to choose a particular bus to track.
